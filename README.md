Before running Django please run database migration part. I did it in MySQL.
This is my first time working with Python, Django and Typescript, and 2nd time working with Reactjs. It was really very challenging task for me. It really took a little time for me to learn new languages, libraries, frameworks and technologies. I also got help from ChatGPT. as a developer I believe that languages should not be any problem. That is all i want to say.
